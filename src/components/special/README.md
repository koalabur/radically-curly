The "special" folder is used for one-off components. With the new app-directory, every file within the app folder is considered server-side by default. This includes in files imported. As of writing this, there is an experimental server actions feature, but it's not ready for production. So, I've created a special folder for components that are used on the client-side and are one-off components. i.e. gsap animations on particular sections.
